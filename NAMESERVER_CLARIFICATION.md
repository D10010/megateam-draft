# 🚨 Nameserver Confusion - Let's Fix This!

## 🤔 **What Happened**
When adding your custom domain in Cloudflare Pages, it likely detected that `megateam.network` isn't using Cloudflare nameservers and suggested switching them. This is **NOT what we want** for your situation.

## ✅ **Correct Approach: Keep Squarespace Nameservers**

### **Why Keep Squarespace Nameservers:**
- ✅ **Keep your existing setup** → Don't break anything that's working
- ✅ **Simple CNAME approach** → Only point `www` subdomain to your site
- ✅ **No migration needed** → Keep your domain management with Squarespace
- ✅ **Less complexity** → Just one DNS record change

### **What We Actually Need:**
- **Domain Management**: Stay with Squarespace ✅
- **Nameservers**: Keep Squarespace nameservers ✅  
- **DNS Record**: Add one CNAME record for `www` ✅
- **Result**: `www.megateam.network` → Your TRON MEGATEAM site

## 🔄 **Correct Setup Process**

### **Step 1: Ignore Cloudflare's Nameserver Suggestion**
When Cloudflare Pages shows nameserver instructions:
- ❌ **Don't change nameservers to Cloudflare**
- ❌ **Don't switch domain management** 
- ✅ **Just add the custom domain** in Pages dashboard
- ✅ **Ignore the DNS zone setup**

### **Step 2: Add Custom Domain (Correctly)**
1. **Cloudflare Pages Dashboard**:
   - Go to Pages → tron-megateam → Custom domains
   - Add `www.megateam.network`
   - **Skip/ignore** any nameserver change suggestions
   - Just note that you'll handle DNS externally

### **Step 3: Configure DNS in Squarespace Only**
1. **Squarespace DNS** (as planned):
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Host: www  
   Target: tron-megateam.pages.dev
   ```
2. **Keep everything else** in Squarespace unchanged

## 🎯 **Two Different Cloudflare Services**

### **Cloudflare Pages** (What we're using):
- **Purpose**: Host your website files
- **DNS Requirement**: Just point your domain to Pages
- **Nameservers**: Can use ANY DNS provider (Squarespace, GoDaddy, etc.)

### **Cloudflare DNS** (What it tried to suggest):
- **Purpose**: Full domain management and DNS hosting
- **Requirement**: Change nameservers to Cloudflare
- **Not Needed**: We don't need this for Pages hosting

## 🛠️ **If You Already Changed Nameservers**

### **Revert Back to Squarespace:**
1. **Go to your domain registrar** (where you bought the domain)
2. **Find DNS/Nameserver settings**
3. **Change nameservers back to Squarespace**:
   ```
   ns1.squarespace.com
   ns2.squarespace.com
   ```
4. **Wait 15-60 minutes** for propagation
5. **Then add the CNAME** in Squarespace DNS

### **Squarespace Nameservers:**
```
Primary: ns1.squarespace.com
Secondary: ns2.squarespace.com
```

## ✅ **Correct Final Setup**

### **Domain Management:**
- **Registrar**: Where you bought the domain
- **DNS Host**: Squarespace (nameservers)
- **Website Host**: Cloudflare Pages

### **DNS Records in Squarespace:**
```
Type    Host    Target                      Purpose
CNAME   www     tron-megateam.pages.dev    → Your TRON site
A       @       [Squarespace IPs]          → Keep existing (if needed)
```

### **URLs After Setup:**
- **www.megateam.network** → Your TRON MEGATEAM website
- **megateam.network** → Whatever you had before (Squarespace site or redirect)

## 🚨 **Red Flags to Avoid**

### **Don't Do These:**
- ❌ Change nameservers to Cloudflare
- ❌ Create a full Cloudflare DNS zone
- ❌ Transfer domain management to Cloudflare  
- ❌ Delete existing Squarespace DNS records

### **Do This Instead:**
- ✅ Keep nameservers with Squarespace
- ✅ Add one CNAME record in Squarespace
- ✅ Add custom domain in Cloudflare Pages only
- ✅ Keep everything else unchanged

## 🎯 **Quick Fix Steps**

### **If You Need to Revert:**
1. **Check current nameservers**: Use [whatsmydns.net](https://whatsmydns.net)
2. **If changed to Cloudflare**: Revert to Squarespace nameservers
3. **Wait for propagation**: 15-60 minutes
4. **Add CNAME in Squarespace**: As originally planned

### **Current Status Check:**
Tell me:
- Did you change the nameservers?
- Are they currently pointing to Cloudflare or Squarespace?
- What does your Squarespace DNS settings page show?

## 💡 **Simple Rule**

**For Cloudflare Pages + External Domain:**
- **Add custom domain** in Cloudflare Pages ✅
- **Keep nameservers** with your current provider ✅  
- **Add CNAME record** in your DNS provider ✅
- **Don't change** domain management ✅

**Your domain should stay managed by Squarespace, just with one new CNAME record pointing the `www` subdomain to your Cloudflare Pages site.**

## 🆘 **Need Help?**

Let me know:
1. **What did you change?** (nameservers, DNS records, etc.)
2. **Current nameserver status** (Squarespace or Cloudflare?)
3. **What you see in Squarespace DNS** settings

I'll help you get this sorted out quickly! 🚀
